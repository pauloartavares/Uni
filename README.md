# Uni

This is my personal University repo. The aim is to share my projects and progress across the degree. 
I'll be periodically updating this repo as I finish my projects.

Project #1: (Language PT-PT)
  It's a classic Noughts and Crosses project, made alongside my colleagues.
  We made it fully in python.
  It's a simple console program, no interface has been made.
  It took us between 1 month and a half and 2 months to conclude. Bear in mind we had to manage times, availability and our jobs and daily life.
  Overall we are satisfied with the result, so is our teacher.
  Grade: 19/20.

Project #2: (Language ENG)
